Implementations of some common data structures and algorithms. These are based on the assignments that are offered in CSE204 course by BUET.

### About
Some of the implementations are based on the assignments that were offered in CSE204 course by BUET. In every folder the main methods are implemented in the corresponding `cpp` or `java` files. Some of the folders contain `.docx` or `.pdf` files that describe the assignments in details. However, the generic implementations are separated from the methods that were required to satisfy the assignment specifications. So, the data structures and algorithms are reusable.
